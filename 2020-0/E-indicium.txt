The two failed attempts, 2 seconds apart, are me trying to test the
code but messing up (again) with the “new” Code Jam interface.

No intended attempted there; reading the analysis, I realize I had
multiple close calls at converging on an actual solution, but no
cigar.  In hindsight, the overarching mistake was to persist trying to
make the diagonal (K mod N) As and N-(K mod N) Bs.  Which fails to
work directly for reasons that are obvious now, but it was pretty late
back then.
