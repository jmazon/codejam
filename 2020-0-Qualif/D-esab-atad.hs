-- $quanta
--
-- That 'QuantumFluctuation' thing is quite the downer.  We can only
-- read 10 bits at the time from the database before everything is
-- shuffled!
--
-- As it turns out, that's not too much of a problem for the easy
-- @B=10@ case: the bits may be shuffled before we even start, but as
-- long as we only query 10 of them, they won't be shuffled again, so
-- our gained knowledge is fresh enough that we can output the result
-- while it's still correct.

-- $pair
--
-- We need to find some way to keep track of the two operations that
-- could happen to a bit in the original database: changes and moves.
-- Changes are what happen when we complement the entire database: the
-- bit's value flips.  Moves are what happen when the database is
-- reversed: the bit's value doesn't change, but its index does.
--
-- So, how are we to make sense of this?  The trick is to always
-- consider a bit as paired with the symmetrical one on the other side
-- of the database, the one it would switch places with if it were
-- reversed.  From a starting database position, we can boil it down
-- to two simple cases:
--
--   * The bits start equal.  In this case, they'll always remain
--     equal, as both operations preserve that.  All we need to track
--     is either of them's value, and we automatically know the other
--     one's without having to query it.  As a parallel to analytical
--     functions, we'll call those 'Even' pairs.
--
--   * The bits start diferent.  In that case, they'll always remain
--     different, as both operations preserve that too.  (It may take
--     just a little more thinking to convince yourself of this, but
--     all there is to it is realizing that both operations have the
--     same start pair and end pair.)  Same as before, all we need to
--     track is either of them's value.  As a parallel to analytical
--     functions, we'll call those 'Odd' pairs.
--
-- What's interesting is that once we've identified a pair's quality,
-- not only will it never change, but we don't actually care about
-- what the operations are anymore!
--
-- So a valid strategy for the medium @B=20@ case would be to:
--
-- 1. identify the pair's quality for pairs 1 to 5 (counterpart
-- indices 16 to 20).  One query per bit, two queries per pair, that's
-- a complete first block of queries before the 'QuantumFluctuation'.
--
-- 2. identify the pair's quality for remaining pairs 6 to 10.  That's
-- another ten queries and another 'QuantumFluctuation'.
--
-- 3. identify each pair's current shuffling status.  Since we now
-- know each pair's quality, this can be done in a single query per
-- pair.
--
-- 4. We're not querying anymore, so there's no next shuffle and we
-- can output the complete database contents.

-- | The 'PairType' represents a 'Pair'\'s quality, depending on its
-- relationship to its counterpart.
data PairType
  = Even -- ^ pairs are those where the counterpart is equal; such
         -- pairs are unaffected by reversals.
  | Odd  -- ^ pairs are those where the counterpart is the negation;
         -- database reversals and complements have the same effect on
         -- such pairs.

-- | Identify the 'PairType' from a pair of 'Bool's.
pairType :: Bool -> Bool -> PairType
pairType x y | x == y = Even
             | x /= y = Odd

-- | The 'Pair' type represents a database bit and its symmetrical
-- counterpart.  For the bit in the first half of the database:
data PairF bool = Pair {
    pairIdx :: HalfIndex   -- ^ remember its index
  , pairValue :: bool      -- ^ remember its value
  } deriving Functor -- ^ a hacky derived instance to get 'fmap' at
                     -- little cost
type Pair = PairF Bool
-- ^ I'm lazily using a parametric @bool@ so I can @DeriveFunctor@ and
-- have a free 'fmap' on the relevant payload, namely the 'pairValue'.
-- In this code, it's only ever going to be used as a 'PairF' 'Bool',
-- hence the type synonym.

-- | Returns a pair's left index.
pairIdxL :: Pair -> Index
pairIdxL = halfToFull . pairIdx

-- | Returns a pair's right index.
pairIdxR :: BitWidth -> Pair -> Index
pairIdxR bw = halfToFullR bw . pairIdx

-- | In addition to `pairValue` which is a record accessor,
-- `pairValueC` returns the pair's symmetrical counterpart's value.
pairValueC :: PairType -> Pair -> Bool
pairValueC Even = pairValue
pairValueC Odd = not . pairValue

-- $batch
--
-- The hard @B=100@ case is going to require more fine-grained
-- information management.
--
-- The insight here is that since the database remains still within a
-- query block, all the pairs read in that timeframe will remain the
-- same with respect to each other, provided they're of the same
-- quality.  For example, with respect to any given bit of a known
-- even pair, the other bits of known even pairs will be have the same
-- value or have the opposite value, but __this will remain true__
-- __after 'QuantumFluctuation's independently of the bits\'__
-- __subsequent value__.
--
-- This is better than having to probe every single pair in a single
-- query block, but it still doesn't cut it for a direct aproach:
-- supposing we'd qualified all 50 pairs of the database, we'd still
-- need to identify each group's shuffle status within a single query
-- block.  But that won't fit: we could have as many as 20 groups (two
-- qualities per block), while we've got the bandwidth to probe only
-- 10 of them.
--
-- So instead of dedicating all of our queries per block to pair
-- qualifying, we'll instead use the first one or two to probe our
-- previous groups' status right after a 'QuantumFluctuation'.  This
-- way, our qualified groups won't be independent from one another
-- anymore, we'll be able to batch them together into only a single
-- batch per pair quality for the entire database.
--
-- Does this fit within the allowable query count?  After the initial
-- block, we'd use up 2 queries to probe, and the remaining 8 to
-- qualify new pairs.  So we cover 8 bits per block, the full 100
-- within 13 blocks.  That's 130 queries or less, it fits!

-- | A `Batch` groups together 'Pair's of a same known (externally)
-- 'PairType'.  If we successfully manage to track one of the batch's
-- representatives' value between 'QuantumFluctuation's, we're able to
-- deduce all the batch's other pairs with no further costly
-- information retrieval!
--
-- The @offset@ parameter enables us to explicitly mark a batch's
-- knowledge as outdated, so we don't accidentally miss a
-- 'QuantumFluctuation' and go out of sync.
data Batch offset
  = Empty -- ^ An empty batch.  Note that those never hold an @offset@.
  | Batch offset (NonEmpty Pair) -- ^ A non-empty batch.
  deriving Functor -- ^ I use the same @DeriveFunctor@ trick, this
                   -- time less idiomatically as the @offset@ can't
                   -- really be considered the payload: this one makes
                   -- for a very easy 'Batch' 'float'ing
                   -- implementation.

-- know, because a 'QuantumFluctuation' happened and we haven't
-- synchronized yet.
type FloatingBatch = Batch ()

-- | A 'BoundBatch' is one whose pairs' values are currently known.

-- $robustM
--
-- To guard against losing track of where I am between two
-- 'QuantumFluctuation's, I'll wrap the database querying with a
-- resource checker, that checks whether the requested query would
-- trigger a reshuffle.  This is implemented with two monad
-- transformers and associated classes:
--
-- * a 'MonadState' 'QueryCount' to count how many queries we
--   performed since the last 'QuantumFluctuation'
--
-- * a 'MonadError' 'QuantumFluctuation' to signal the special
--   condition

-- $robustM2
--
-- For reference, the other constraints we encounter in the type
-- signatures:
--
--   * 'MonadReader' 'BitWidth' stores the global constant @B@.
--
--   * 'MonadIO' is a telltale indicator that the affected functions
--     end up interacting with the judge.  If I find the time and
--     don't get frustrated by too much fighting against Google Code
--     Jam's antique GHC version, I'd like to extract the protocol to
--     a higher level of safety, and likely replace this with a free
--     monad.
